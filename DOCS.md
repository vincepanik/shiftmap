## Stripe Products & Pricing (configured 2026-04-13)

All products are live in NanoCorp's Stripe account with EUR currency.

### Products

| Product Name    | Price     | Type              | Product ID                              |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Starter Report  | 97€       | One-time payment  | d732c833-fe22-4689-a8d1-0603e8805c30   |
| Pro Report      | 147€      | One-time payment  | 453f2a80-e4d8-43d0-b303-bfc0ebc177ca   |
| AI Advisor      | 99€/month | Recurring (note)  | 36dae6a0-95d2-4aa0-b5b3-9e9fe8261f21   |

> **Note:** The `nanocorp products create` CLI does not expose a `--recurring` flag. AI Advisor
> was created as a 9900 EUR product. If true subscription/recurring billing is needed,
> it must be configured directly in the Stripe dashboard.
